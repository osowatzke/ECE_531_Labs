\section{Introduction}
%Introduction to the laboratory experiment, including a brief description of the objectives and goals.

\section{Procedure}
% Detailed explanation of the laboratory experiment, including the design, implementation, and testing of the system.

\subsection{Industrial Input/Output (IIO)}
\label{section::industrial_input_output}

We can use the \texttt{iio\_info -s} command to identify the PlutoSDR device's Universal Resource Identifier (URI). We execute the provided command in an SSH terminal session connected to the embedded PlutoSDR operating system and in a local PC terminal. After executing the command in both terminals, we compare the resulting URIs.

Next, we use the \texttt{iio\_attr} command in the SSH terminal to locate the \textit{ad9361-phy} device. Once we find the device, we use the following command to verify the device name:

\begin{center}
\texttt{cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/$<$iio\_device$>$/name}
\end{center}

where \texttt{$<$iio\_device$>$} is the IIO device we find with the \texttt{iio\_attr} command. Then, we use the \texttt{iio\_attr} command to list the attributes of the \textit{ad9361-phy} device.

\subsection{MATLAB Loopback}

In this experiment, we perform a loopback test by connecting the Pluto SDR's transmit and receive ports together with a coaxial SMA cable. Once the cable is properly connected, we execute the provided \texttt{loopback.m} script to perform a physical collect. After validating that our loopback collect works, we evaluate the impact of the \textit{GainSource} (AGC) settings by testing each possible configuration: \textit{Manual}, \textit{AGC Slow Attack}, and \textit{AGC Fast Attack}. To characterize the impact of these settings, we modify the transmitted signal. We perform one collect while varying the amplitude of the signal and another collect with zero portions added to the signal. Finally, we determine what gain values are necessary to turn the receive sinusoid into a square wave (saturate the signal).

\subsection{GNU Radio Loopback}
\label{section::gnu_radio_loopback}

We can perform a similar loopback experiment using GNU Radio instead of MATLAB. For this test, we use the provided \texttt{PlutoTestSine.grc} flowchart. The lab also mentions a QT GUI Time Sink, which is not included in the provided flowchart. To meet the requirements of this experiment, we have added the time sink to the flowchart. The resulting flowchart is shown in Figure \ref{fig::gnu_radio_loopback_flowchart0}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{gnu_radio_loopback_flowchart0.png}}}
	\caption{GNU Radio Flowchart for Loopback Test}
	\label{fig::gnu_radio_loopback_flowchart0}
\end{figure}

Before we run the flowchart, we review the properties of the PlutoSDR blocks. We specifically review the RF bandwidth and its impact on performance. Then, we describe what the "Cyclic" option does in the PlutoSDR sink. Finally, we discuss the effects of Manual Gain control in the Pluto SDR and review alternative gain control strategies.

After reviewing the PlutoSDR blocks, we run the flowchart and determine the RX gain where the signal distorts (or clips). Next, we replace the "QT Time Sink" and "QT Frequency Sink" blocks with a "QT GUI Sink" block. Using the updated block, we examine the impacts of increasing the number of averages and changing the window function. Then, we determine the transmitted RF frequency and explain how our transmitter configuration produced this frequency.

\subsection{GNU Radio as a libIIO Client}

For this experiment, we replace the PlutoSDR source and sink blocks with generic IIO blocks. The generic IIO blocks and their default values are given in Figure \ref{fig::generic_iio_blocks}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{generic_iio_blocks.png}}}
	\caption{Generic IIO Blocks with Default Values}
	\label{fig::generic_iio_blocks}
\end{figure}

After replacing the PlutoSDR source and sink blocks with the blocks shown in Figure \ref{fig::generic_iio_blocks}, we repeat the experiment from Section \ref{section::gnu_radio_loopback}. Then, we change the TX and RX frequencies from 2.4 GHz to 915 MHz and increase the sample rates from 2.084 MSPS to a higher arbitrarily-chosen sampling rate. Finally, we verify that each of these settings are correctly applied using IIO Scope plugins and the \texttt{iio\_attr} command. 
 
\section{Results}
\subsection{Industrial Input/Output (IIO)}

In this section, we display the results from the industrial input/output commands provided in Section \ref{section::industrial_input_output}. Figure \ref{fig::iio_info_putty} displays the results of the \texttt{iio\_info -s} command, when executed in Putty (an SSH terminal).  

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{iio_info_putty.png}}
	\caption{Result of \texttt{iio\_info -s} Command when Executed in Putty}
	\label{fig::iio_info_putty}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig::iio_info_cmd} shows the outputs of the same command when executed in command prompt, a local PC terminal.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{iio_info_cmd.png}}
	\caption{Result of \texttt{iio\_info -s} Command when Executed in Command Prompt}
	\label{fig::iio_info_cmd}
\end{figure}

Compared to the outputs shown in Figure \ref{fig::iio_info_putty}, the command prompt output shows very similar URIs. Both contain an ip:pluto.local URI with an IP address of 192.168.2.1. They also both contain an additional ip:pluto.local URI, which is nearly the same. However, the biggest difference between the two outputs is in the final URI. The SSH output shows a local URI (local:), while the command prompt output shows a USB URI (usb:1.31.5). We note that command prompt also contains an additional warning message, which says "Unable to create Local IIO context: Function not implemented (40)." This warning message is described in more detail in \cite{analog_devices_libiio_error}. However, it is expected warning because \texttt{iio\_info} tries to open local contexts, which are not supported in Windows. For comparison, we run the same command on the Virtual Machine. The results of this command are display in Figure \ref{fig::iio_info_vm}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{iio_info_vm.png}}
	\caption{Result of \texttt{iio\_info -s} Command when Executed in Virtual Machine}
	\label{fig::iio_info_vm}
\end{figure}

Compared to the results of Figure \ref{fig::iio_info_cmd}, we see that the IIO context warning message is no longer present. Next, we use the \texttt{iio\_attr -d} command without a device to list all the devices. The output of this command is listed in Figure \ref{fig::iio_devices}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{iio_devices.png}}
	\caption{List of IIO Devices}
	\label{fig::iio_devices}
\end{figure}

Examining the command output, we find that \textit{ad9361-phy} corresponds to iio:device0. With the following command, we can get the name of iio:device0 and confirm our findings:

\begin{center}
\texttt{cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/name}
\end{center}

The outputs of this command are given in Figure \ref{fig::iio_device0_name}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{iio_device0_name.png}}
	\caption{Confirming Name of ``iio:device0"}
	\label{fig::iio_device0_name}
\end{figure}

Examining the command outputs, we find that the name of iio:device0 is \textit{ad9361-phy} as expected. We can pass the name of the device as an argument to the \text{iio\_attr -d} command to list the attributes of the device. The results of this command are given in Figure \ref{fig::iio_raw_attributes}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{iio_raw_attributes.png}}
	\caption{Attributes for the \textit{ad9361-phy} Device}
	\label{fig::iio_raw_attributes}
\end{figure}

This command gives the device attributes and their values. However, the command window is very cluttered. We can extract just the attribute names from the command output using a combination of \texttt{grep} and \texttt{sed} as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig::iio_filtered_attributes}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{iio_filtered_attributes.png}}
	\caption{Filtering Output of \texttt{iio\_attr} Command}
	\label{fig::iio_filtered_attributes}
\end{figure}
