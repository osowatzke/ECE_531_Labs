- srrcFreqResponse.m and pulseShaping.m generate the results for section 3.1
- capturePlutoConstellation.m generates the results for section 3.2
- custom symbol timing synchronization routines are included in the textbook and timingCorrection subfolders
    - The textbook subfolder uses routines provided by the textbook
    - The timingCorrection subfolder uses custom matlab.System objects
- testTimingCorrection.m compares the outputs of the custom routines to MATLAB's comm.SymbolSynchronizer
- simTimingSync.m generates the results for sections 3.3 and 3.4
- plutoTimingSync.m generates the results for section 3.5
