\section{Introduction}
%Introduction to the laboratory experiment, including a brief description of the objectives and goals.

\section{Procedure}
% Detailed explanation of the laboratory experiment, including the design, implementation, and testing of the system.

In this lab, we implement a monostatic CW radar with the PlutoSDR. We specifically use GNU radio to implement our radar and test it using a box fan. In our data, we explain the strong DC return and discuss physical changes that can be made to reduce the power of this return. Using the measured doppler shift, we also approximate the angular velocity of the box fan blades. Then, we discuss how an interfering signal could affect the operation of our radar and propose changes to make the design more resilient to interference. Finally, we discuss how the design can be updated to support range measurements.

\section{Results}
% Results and discussion of the laboratory experiment, including captured outputs, observations, and responses to laboratory questions.

In this section, we create a GNU radio flowchart to implement a CW radar. Our flowchart is shown in Figure \ref{fig::gnu_radio_block_diagram}. In this flowchart, we transmit a 10 kHz sinusoid at a 2.4 GHz carrier frequency. Then, we receive the sinusoid with a 500 kHz sampling rate and RF bandwidth. Note that this is much greater than twice the highest frequency (10 kHz plus a doppler shift), so we could further reduce our sampling rate if desired. However, if we did so, we should also reduce the RF bandwidth to reduce the amount of noise that aliases back into our spectrum. Next, we perform AGC on the received signal and signal source to maintain signal power. However, both these blocks are optional and can be removed because our transmitted signal has a fixed signal power and because we are performing AGC in the PlutoSDR.

Note that this radar can only sense 

Two common causes of the DC return in our data are clutter (from stationary returns) and transmitter leakage. We can minimize clutter with a tighter antenna pattern or by operating in an controlled environment, such as an anechoic chamber. However, it is usually not possible for us to constrain our environment. Antenna isolation achieved through a tighter antenna pattern or other techniques can be help us achieve better antenna isolation. We can also consider other design such as pulsed doppler radars. However, these radars may not be applicable in all cases (especially with close targets). In the lab, we used a notch filter to remove DC. However, we could have also removed or ignored the offending doppler bins in post-processing.

An interfering signal would negatively impact the CW radar operation. If it was a wideband signal (such as 802.11 WiFi), it could mask the entire bandwidth of our signal and make detection more difficult. Conversely, if the interfering signal was narrow (worse case a tone), it could lead to false detections. To mitigate interference, we should try to minimize the utilized bandwidth. In the sample flowchart, provided in the lab, the RF bandwidth was larger than the sample rate. Tightening the RF bandwidth could prevent interference from aliasing into our bandwidth. Additionally, if the interference is high power, tightening our RF bandwidth can prevent the AGC from acting on interference and increase the effective number of bits for our return. We can also implement more sophisticated techniques to mitigate interference. For example, we can use a coded waveform such as a Barker code or Zadoff-chu waveform to increase the coherent gain on our returns. Additionally, having a tighter antenna pattern can reduce the interference power and increase the power of returns. If we had a ULA, we could even implement beamforming to null signals from specific directions of arrival.

We can extend our design to compute range measurements if we replace our sinusoid with a chirp. This is done in FMCW radars, for example, which we illustrate in Figure \ref{fig::fmcw_radar}

\begin{figure}[H]
    	\centering
    	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{FMCW Blockdiagram}}
    	\caption{Typical FMCW Block Diagram \cite{9613183}}
    	\label{fig::fmcw_radar}
\end{figure}
	
\noindent In an FMCW radar, we generate our chirp waveform with a VCO.  Typical transmit and receive signals are shown in Figure \ref{fig::fmcw_spectrogram}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    	\caption{Time Frequency Plot for Transmit and Receive Signal.\cite{Long2019AssistingTV}}
    	\label{fig::fmcw_spectrogram}
\end{figure}

\noindent After mixing we get a tone with a frequency that is proportional to range. If we limit the maximum resolvable range, we can use a sample rate that is much smaller than the chirp bandwidth, which allows us to use much cheaper hardware. As shown in Figure \ref{fig::fmcw_radar}, we can then use an FFT to detect range. Additionally, we can resolve doppler by taking a slow-time FFT across pulses.
